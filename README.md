# About
*The heart of suffering*

Originally this had began as a project to control minecraft mods using discord. This python project uses rcon to execute minecraft commands externally from the minecraft server instance itself. It integrates with discord so any specially formatted commands are interpreted as syntax to command the minecraft world. I am currently working on integrating the bot with Twitch to Twitch Chat can directly manipulate the minecraft world. Maybe it's because I hate myself. Maybe it's because I love my community.

# Controlling The Bot
*"Clever girl"*

The bot can be controlled via Discord and Twitch. Commands given to the bot make changes to the minecraft world the bot is connected to.

## Discord Commands
The bot can be controlled from discord using specially formatted commands posted in any text chat on the server. The advantage of using discord to control the bot is that you have no limit to the amount of commands to can post, but you will be required to join the discord server.
| Command | Switches | Description |
| ------- | -------- | ----------- |
|         | VCC      | VCC         |

### Admin Commands
Commands only Discord server admins can run
| Command | Switches | Description |
| ------- | -------- | ----------- |
|         | VCC      | VCC         |

## Twitch Cheers
The bot can be controlled directly from Twitch Chat using Cheers. When Cheers of specific amounts are posted, the corresponding bot plugin is activated in the minecraft world.

*Bit amounts are subject to change after balancing*
